# apodR

The goal of apodR is to connect R to the NASA APOD API. The APOD API supports one image at a time. In order to suplly more than that, this package also includes creating time ranges (of less than 1000 days ata time) and some historical data in tibble format.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("eringrand/apodR")
```
## Example

This is a basic example to retrive APOD data. If you do not give an end date, it will assume you want up untill today.

```{r example}
library(dplyr)
library(apodR)
library(DT)
get_apod(start_date = "2018-04-03")
```
